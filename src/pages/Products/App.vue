                  Some extra knowledge about peas: Fresh peas vs Frozen peas
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Peas' sugars turn into starch as soon as they are picked.
                  After 24 hours, those sweet little green gems can be grainy
                  and dull-tasting. Frozen peas, on the other hand, are picked
                  and frozen at the peak of ripeness, halting the process of
                  sugars turning to starch, so frozen peas are much better and
                  will have the sweet taste you're looking for even after
                  several months without any addition of preservatives! Plus,
                  you don't have to do any podding! Generally, frozen
                  vegetables/products retain more vitamins and seems to taste
                  fresher. Frozen vegetables/products have advantages over fresh
                  ones as the same are available when the fresh counterpart is
                  out-of-season. They have practically infinite shelf life when
                  kept in a freezer.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Knowledge on Recovery/yield</h4>
                <p>
                  Fresh peas with pods have approximately 35% to 40% recovery
                  i.e. for every 1 kg of pea pod you buy you will get only about
                  350 to 400 grams of peas so buying 1 kg of frozen peas is
                  equivalent to buying 2.5 kg of peas with pods. This means that
                  the cost and effort of using frozen peas is very less!
                </p>
                <p>
                  As long ago as 1959, sales of frozen peas in Britain overtook
                  sales of pods, despite the fact that very few households owned
                  a freezer at this point.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In India, still only about 10% of the peas consumption is of
                  frozen peas and 90% of peas are consumed fresh. This is
                  primarily due to unawareness in Indian consumers that frozen
                  peas are as healthy, nutritious and sweet as freshly picked
                  peas. Also they are much cheaper than peas with pods during
                  off-season and don’t require any podding.
